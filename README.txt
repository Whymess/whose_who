Summary: 

In a large organization, when people are scattered throughout the world it is hard to meet everyone on your team.  This application solves this common problem, by providing informational profiles of colleagues and helpful trivia questions which help you stay informed about your teammates. 

This README will document my journey as I complete the above. In addition, this also aspires to give you valuable resource into how to plan and develop a front-end application, specifically in React.JS. Each module will be explained below. This project should take approximately four to six weeks.
